What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. What does the vertical axis in the third chart represent?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. The number of agricultural producers in each country\nB. The level of agricultural subsidies provided by each country\nC. The Producer Nominal Protection Coefficient in 2020\nD.

If a chart has multiple labels from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct label.
