        "question": "Question: What is the lowest labeled tick value on the vertical axis in the second chart? \nNote that your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'. \nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get.",

What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in second the chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom.
