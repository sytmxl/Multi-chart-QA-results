Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom.  You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. The percentage of the population with access to electricity in each country in 2021. \nB. The GDP per capita of each country in 2021. \nC. The total population of each country in 2021. \nD. The change in electricity access from 2020 to 2021. \n2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
