What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that: Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when the vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many labeled countries are there on the vertical axis of the second chart?\nNote that your final answer should be a natural number.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
