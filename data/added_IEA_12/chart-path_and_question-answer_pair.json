        "question": "Question:\n1. What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'. \n2. Which region shows the largest increase in global oil demand from the second chart?\nNote that this is a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. You should only output the option, such as A, B, or C, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. India\nB.
