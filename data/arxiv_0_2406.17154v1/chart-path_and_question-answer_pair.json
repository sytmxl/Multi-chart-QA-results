        "question": "Question: What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the horizontal axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. What is the total number of distinct and explicitly labeled ticks across all axes in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct and explicitly labeled ticks across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots. If a chart has multiple subplots with identical ticks, count those ticks as one. If the chart does not have any explicit labeled ticks across all axes, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

        "question": "Question: How many identical labels are there in the legends of the first chart and the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of identical labels in the legends of the first chart and the second chart across multiple subplots. And your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If any of the plots do not have a legend, or if the legend is not considered relevant to the plot, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "Question: First find the nearest horizontal tick value, noted as v1, of Wavenumber when the Transmittance(%) of 50\u00b0 reaches its maximum in the subplot of 1.8 \u03bcm SHU, TE Transmission in the first chart. Then when Wavenumber = v1 in the 1.5 \u03bcm DHU, In-Plane TE Reflection subplot in the second chart, what is the approximate vertical value of the line 180\u00b0?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart.
