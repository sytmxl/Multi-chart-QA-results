        "question": "Question: What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

What is the peak number of whales killed in a single year according to the first chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\n2. What does the horizontal axis of the second chart represent?\nNote that This is a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. The years from 1890 to 2001.\nB. The decline in global whale populations over time.\nC. The percentage change in whale populations from 1890 to 2001.\nD. The total whale populations in the pre-whaling period versus 2001.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
