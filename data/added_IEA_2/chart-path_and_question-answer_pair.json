        "question": "Question: What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'. \nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get.",

How many distinct technologies are labeled on the horizontal axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct technologies labeled on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled technologies on the horizontal axis, answer '0'. \n2. What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the horizontal axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
