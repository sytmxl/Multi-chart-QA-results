        "question": "Question: What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "Question: 1. What is the general trend of data from left to right in the second chart?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Increasing\nB. Decreasing\nC. Decreasing then increasing\nD. Increasing then decreasing\n2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n3. What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
