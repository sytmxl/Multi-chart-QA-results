What is the percentage gap between women who are married to men and women who have never been married in terms of taking their spouse's last name in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to a number, even if it is an approximate value.

Which race group has the largest percentage of people who took spouse's last name when they got married in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart.
