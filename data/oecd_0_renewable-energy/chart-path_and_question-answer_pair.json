When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many countries are there on the horizontal axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the horizontal axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple countries from different subplots with the same name, count them as only one distinct country.
