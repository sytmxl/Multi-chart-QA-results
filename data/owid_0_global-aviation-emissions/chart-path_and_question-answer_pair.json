What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. What is the trend of CO\u2082 emissions (billion tonnes) from 1990 to 2021 in the first chart? \nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question.  You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA.

What is the nearest vertical axis tick value to the aviation's share of global CO\u2082 emissions in 2010 in the second chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart.
