When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many colours are used for the bars in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of colours used for the bars in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a bar plot, answer '0'.\n3. How many labels are there on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labels on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labels on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the three questions.
