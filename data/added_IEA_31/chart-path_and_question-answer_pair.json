When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many labeled categories are there in the legend of the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled categories in the legend, including the case when legends are shared across multiple subplots.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
