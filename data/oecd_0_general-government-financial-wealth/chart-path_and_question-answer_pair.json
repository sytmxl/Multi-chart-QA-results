You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. General government financial wealth in various countries.\nB. The different countries ranked by their GDP.\nC. The total population of each country.\nD. The percentage change in financial wealth.\n2.

When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
