What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal colour bar in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal colour bar that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal colour bar is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal colour bar is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the colour bar at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the colour bar label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal colour bar, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many distinct lines are there in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct lines in the chart across multiple subplots. Ignore grid lines, tick marks, and any vertical or horizontal auxiliary lines. If the plot does not contain any lines or is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\n2.
