        "question": "Question: What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Elo Rating\nB. Total Points\nC. Elo Deviation\nD. Correct - Incorrect Rating\n2.

If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If these two charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

You need to identify which label appears as a Judge Model and also has the largest gap of Elo Rating between the correct version and the incorrect version.
