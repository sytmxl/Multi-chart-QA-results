Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or the legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many distinct lines are there in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct lines in the chart across multiple subplots. Ignore grid lines, tick marks, and any vertical or horizontal auxiliary lines. If the plot does not contain any lines or is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
