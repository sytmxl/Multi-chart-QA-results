What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many colors are used for the lines in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of colors used for the lines in the chart across multiple subplots. If the plot is not considered a line plot, answer '0'. \nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
