        "question": "Question: What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

What is the difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the color bar in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the color bar, including the case when the color bar is shared across multiple subplots. When the color bar is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit color bar tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.

If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\nNote that your answer should be a full name of the drug.
