What is the lowest value of the color bar in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to a number that is exlicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart, even if it is an approximate value. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\n2. What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

        "question": "Question: How many of the same tick values are there on the vertical axis in the second chart and the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values on the vertical axis across multiple subplots in the second chart and the third chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value. If the 2 and the 3 charts do not have ticks with the same label on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

Around which <|v|> (%) value does the parameter \u03c1Q oscillate in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\n2. What is the <|v|> (%) value that makes the curve of Rhigh=160 peak in right subplot of the second chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest horizontal tick value in the chart. You should omit the unit after any number. You are allowed to extract numbers within some text when needed.\nNow that you have got the answer for the above two questions, the final answer is the answer to the first question plus the answer to the second question.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
