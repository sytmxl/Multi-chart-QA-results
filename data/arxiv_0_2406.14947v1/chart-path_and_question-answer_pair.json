Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Increasing\nB. Increasing then decreasing\nC. Decreasing then increasing\nD. Decreasing\n2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

And your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If any of the plots do not have a legend, or if the legend is not considered relevant to the plot, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
