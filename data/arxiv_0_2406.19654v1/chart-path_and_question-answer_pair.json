        "question": "Question: What is difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

        "question": "Question: 1. What does the horizontal axis of the second chart represent?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Delay  \nB. Frequency [MHz]  \nC. Time [ms]  \nD. Residual  \n2. What is the value of the blue point on the right side of the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
