        "question": "Question: What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

What is the nearest labeled tick value on the vertical axis to the value of the light blue line at its peak in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer must be approximated to the nearest vertical tick value in the chart.
