        "question": "Question: What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the second chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when the vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit vertical axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

(from top to bottom, then left to right) \nNote that You should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or the legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'. \n2. What is the spatially lowest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when the vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. You should omit any units apart from the numbers. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

        "question": "Question: How many of the same tick values are there across all axes in the first chart and the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the number of the same tick values across all axes, including the case when any axis is shared across multiple subplots in the first chart and the second chart. If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
