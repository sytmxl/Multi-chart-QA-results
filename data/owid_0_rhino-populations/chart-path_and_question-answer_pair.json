When the horizontal color bar is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the color bar at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the color bar label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal color bar, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
