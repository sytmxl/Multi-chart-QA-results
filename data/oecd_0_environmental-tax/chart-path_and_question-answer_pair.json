If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2.What does the horizontal axis of the third chart represent?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. If the chart has multiple subplots, answer based on the subplot on the left and at the bottom. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Types of environmental taxes\nB. Countries\nC. Years\nD. Percentage of GDP\n3.
