If the plot does not have an explicit title or contains only a letter, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. What is the rightmost labeled tick on the horizontal axis in the first chart? \nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the horizontal axis that is explicitly written, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
