When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Year-over-year growth rate in AI investment\nB. Number of companies investing in AI\nC. Average investment size per company in AI\nD. Total corporate investment in AI in USD\n2. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots.
