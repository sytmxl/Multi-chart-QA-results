When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many subplots are there in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of subplots in the plot. If the plot does not contain subplots, answer '1'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

(from top to bottom, then left to right)\nNote that You should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or no legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n3. What is the general trend of Anomaly line from left to right in the capsule subplot of the first chart?\nNote that This a choice question. Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA.
