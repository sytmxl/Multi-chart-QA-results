Your final answer should be the option that most closely matches the question. You should only output the option, such as A, B, C, or D, as the answer without the content in the option.\nA. Increasing\nB. Increasing then decreasing\nC. Decreasing then increasing\nD. Decreasing\n2. What is the spatially highest labeled tick on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the tick value on the vertical axis that is explicitly written, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.
