When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left.

What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis in the third chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the vertical axis, including the case when vertical axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the vertical axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot.
