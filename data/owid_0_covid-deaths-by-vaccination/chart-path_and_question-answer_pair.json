Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\n2. How many distinct lines are there in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of distinct lines in the chart across multiple subplots. Ignore grid lines, tick marks, and any vertical or horizontal auxiliary lines. If the plot does not contain any lines or is not considered a line plot, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
