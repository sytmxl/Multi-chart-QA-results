        "question": "Question:\n1. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis in the second chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the tick labels on the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2. How many labeled ticks are there on the vertical axis in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer should be the total number of labeled ticks on the vertical axis across multiple subplots. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer '0'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.

If a chart has multiple ticks from different subplots with the same value, count them as only one distinct tick value.

In which country do the projected number of air conditioning units increase the most from 1990 to 2020 in the first chart?\nNote that Your final answer must be grounded to some text that is explicitly written and relevant to the question in the chart. If you need to answer multiple terms, separate them with commas. Unless specified in the question (such as answering with a letter), you are required to answer the full names of subplots and/or labels by default.\n2. Does the global carbon emission gap between heating and cooling almost remain the same each year in the second chart?\nNote that the answer should be Yes or No.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
