When the color bar is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the color bar, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
