When the vertical axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis at the left.

If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the vertical axis, answer 'Not Applicable'.\n2.

When the horizontal axis is present on both the top and bottom of the plot, answer based on the axis at the bottom.
