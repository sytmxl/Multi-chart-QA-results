(from top to bottom, then left to right) \nNote that You should write down the labels from top to bottom, then from left to right and separate the labels with commas. Your final answer should account for only labels relevant to the plot in the legend, even if the legend is located outside the plot. If the plot does not have a legend or no legend is not considered relevant to this plot, answer 'Not Applicable'. \n2. What is the difference between consecutive numerical tick values on the horizontal axis in the first chart?\nNote that your final answer should be the difference between consecutive numerical tick values of the horizontal axis, including the case when the horizontal axis is shared across multiple subplots. When the horizontal axis is present on both the left and right of the plot, answer based on the axis on the right. Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the axis label or the corner of the plot. If the plot does not have an explicit horizontal axis tick value, or if the tick values are not numerical, or if the difference is not constant between all consecutive tick values, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNow that you have got the answers for the two questions.
